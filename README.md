# Meteor-Defender
Meteror Defender is a game project that I worked on for a few months. It involves python with the pygame extension. The goal of the game is to defend your base against meteors and upgrade and become stronger. This game utilizes the mouse only, future abilities and features may be added later on. To play the game, download all files and folders (except for README.md and the license) into a single folder and run the game.py file in a compiler. Make sure you have the pygame extension added as it will not work without it. Enjoy playing!
